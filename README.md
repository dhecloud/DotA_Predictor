# DotA_Predictor

## Overview
DotA2 is a MOBA and has been one of the most played games on Steam, with over a million concurrent players at its peak. Its competitive scene is lively and boisterous, and players with the compedium of the season can often bet with virtual currency on the outcome of the game.
Drafting of the heroes in each team are of paramount importance and is a huge factor in determining which team has the highest probability of winning. As such, I have decided to write a simple predictor based on hero picks to guess accurately the outcome of the game.

This model is based on patch 7.06f. More features like MMR and roles might be added in the future.
